## Homework Assignment #9: NODE.JS
________________________________________

### Overview:
- For this homework assignment I was tasked with creating an application that will allow users to create their own professional README using node js

### Process:
- In the process of creating this application, I used the nmp libray, specifically the 'inquire' to alert the promts to the users. Furthermore the 'fs' directory was used to write file once the input of the user was given
